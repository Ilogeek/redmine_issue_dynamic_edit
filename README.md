# âœ¨  redmine_issue_dynamic_edit

Add new elements on detailed issue page to **dynamically update issue's attributes and custom fields**, directly in the details block of the issue **without any page refresh** (*JIRA style*).


### ðŸ”´  What info you should provide when opening an issue
>Please list your installed plugins and the Redmine version you use. Note that I can't fix every issue when you have conflict with an other plugin that also edit the page.
>
>This plugin use JS a lot. Check your JS console from your web browser ( [HowTo](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/77337) ) and try again to reproduce your issue. You'll see some information about what goes wrong. 
>
>Copy and paste the result that appears in your console in the Github issue and expand all possible object (error data for example). With this data, we can look if there's a problem with the ajax call the plugin performs to update the issue or if there's any JS error.

### ðŸ”Ž  Example

### ðŸ“¦  Installation

* If you update the plugin, be sure to save your configuration modification (`assets/javascripts/issue_dynamic_edit_configuration_file.js`) in a safe place to set them back after the update 
* Clone repo into plugins directory : `git clone https://github.com/Ilogeek/redmine_issue_dynamic_edit.git` (be sure that the parent folder is called `redmine_issue_dynamic_edit`)
* Restart your Redmine instance

### âš™  Configuration (new since v 0.6.6)

You can set some settings by editing the file `assets/javascripts/issue_dynamic_edit_configuration_file.js`. Inside this file you'll find different variable :
* **\_CONF\_FORCE\_HTTPS** : Will force AJAX call performed by the plugin to be done with https protocol. Use this value if you encounter some difficulties with "Mixed content" issues 
* **\_CONF\_DISPLAY\_EDIT\_ICON** : Choose if hovering the details block will display all the pencil icons next to editable values or if the user has to hover every value to check if (s)he can edit it. Allowed value : `single`, `block`
* **\_CONF\_LISTENER\_TYPE\_VALUE** : Choose which action will trigger the apparition of the edition block when fired from the current value. Allowed value : `none`, `click`, `dblclick`
* **\_CONF\_LISTENER\_TYPE\_ICON** : Choose which action will trigger the apparition of the edition block when fired from the pencil icon (by default: same as **\_CONF\_LISTENER\_TYPE\_VALUE**). Allowed value : `none`, `click`, `dblclick`
* **\_CONF\_LISTENER\_TARGET** : Choose which area will trigger the apparition of the edition block
* **\_CONF\_EXCLUDED\_FIELD\_ID** : Choose which fields to exclude. They won't have the edit block and pencil. Eg: `TitleInput`, `DescriptionInput`, `statusListDropdown` ...
* **\_CONF\_CHECK\_ISSUE\_UPDATE\_CONFLICT** : Choose if you allow current user to override all modifications performed by other users while editing the issue

### ðŸŽ¨  Customization

Feel free to edit `assets/stylesheets/issue_dynamic_edit.css` to update the look of your fields depending on your current Redmine Theme.
